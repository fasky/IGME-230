# Spear of Cassius

## High Concept
Fight a variety of giant monsters to reach the Spear. Kung Fu Master meets Evangelion.

## Genre
Beat 'em up or fighting.

## Platform
Web, for desktop.

## Story
The city is under attack by numerous giant monsters, and it is up to the player to reach the Spear to take down the master that is floating in the sky. The player controls a giant robot, excitingly fighting diverse enemies on the way through the city to the Spear. 

## Esthetics
Graphics - Pixel Art, colorful.

Sound - looping music. One track for menu, one for gameplay, and one for ending. Maybe play with the idea of changing when fighting certain enemies.

Try to have sounds for every action, from button clicks to punches. 

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
Countdown - May have a visible countdown somewhere on screen, will decide while testing the game. Would add more urgency and excitement, I think.

Get new weapons or abilities, or moves with each defeated enemy.

Levels - May divide enemies into levels, or make it a side-scroller.

Visible Health Bar

Hit combos/ hit counter - show the user how good they are doing.

Satisfying enemy deaths and power-up obtainment.

Using WASD to attack, throw punches, hit, etc.

Using arrow keys to move.



### Controls
Keyboard - WASD (fighting) and arrow keys (moving).

### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"
There will be a screen that shows the controls before the game starts.
 
### Player Learning
They may learn the enemies moves and range, and their own range and moves. They can use movement and attacks in tandem. May have power-ups tied to hit streaks, or new weapons or abilities from each defeated enemy. Timing and length of attacks would be good to learn. Also how much damage certain attacks may do.
